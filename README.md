# bst-construction

Difficulty: medium

  Write a BST  class for a Binary Search Tree. The class should support:
  * Inserting values with the insert  method.
  * Removing values with the remove  method; this method should only remove the first instance of a given value.
  * Searching for values with the contains  method.
  
  
  Note that you can't remove values from a single-node tree. In other words,
  calling the remove method on a single-node tree should simply not
  do anything.
  
  
  Each BST node has an integer value, a left child node, and a right  child node. A node is
  said to be a valid BST  node if and only if it satisfies the BST property: its value  is strictly greater than the values of every
  node to its left; its value  is less than or equal to the values of every node to its right; and its children nodes are either valid BST
  nodes themselves or None / null.
